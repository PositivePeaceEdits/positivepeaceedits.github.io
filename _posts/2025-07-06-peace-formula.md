# Overview

I appreciate this book by economist Dominic Rohner. 
It's a thoroughly researched presentation, from a rationalist IR perspective, about necessary ingredients for peace, supporting conditions, how those things need to come together, and what happens when they don't.

Though it felt incomplete at times, this didn't take away from the book's usefulness and contribution. 
I wish more scholars like Rohner synthesized their work in an accessible way.

# Summary

## Definitions

Rohner examines **armed conflict**,  defined as organized, politically motivated violence. 

Classification of conflict:
  - One sided conflict - such as state repression against its own population
  - Two-sided conflict - armed violence between groups

Another way to classify conflict:
  - Civil war, or intra-state
  - International, or between states
  - *Internationalized* civil wars: conflicts that draw interventions from foreign powers. Some of these can be proxy wars, but not always.

Conflict from the rationalist perspective is viewed as a **bargaining failure**.[^3] "Barganing failure" may at first blush sound like a negotiation that breaks down. But it actually includes a wide range of scenarios, including what may really be coercion or domination. 
In cases of asymmetrical power - think colonialism or imperial aggression - the "bargaining" may look like:
  - Group 1 (more powerful): surrender and give us what we want, or be destroyed
  - Group 2 (less powerful): we surrender and give you what you want ("rational" response assumed to avoid an even less desirable outcome)

One [critique](https://api.repository.cam.ac.uk/server/api/core/bitstreams/1f8b4249-5fa2-45a3-9f2a-21d69cde5a27/content) of this view is that it views coercion as "success" and normalizes aggression, while diminishing reasons to defend against oppression.

## Causes of conflict

Why and when do bargaining failures happen? The causes described in this book are:
1. **Asymmetrical information** (e.g. not understanding an opponent's strength or resolve to fight back) [^1]
2. **Commitment problems** [^4] - related to trust and changing power dynamics. Include:
    - Pre-emptive war (one side fears attack from another, strikes first)
    - Preventive war (another group growing in power and is feared to be a threat in the future, attack now while they're weaker )
    - Fear of retaliation, e.g. after cease fire and disarment. Prolongs civil wars.
6. **Political bias** -  private incentives among people in power that are not aligned with population (which stands to suffer from conflict) and isolation from negative consequences.
7. Bargaining over **indivisibilities** (e.g. a geographic region with special significance)

Factors like poverty increase the likelihood of conflict by lowering the opportunity costs of fighting, but are not viewed as causes. 

## The peace formula

Peace is not explicitly defined in the book. 
But whatever "peace" is, the book treats it as going beyond the absence of violent conflict (negative peace) 
and devotes significant attention to conditions for some minimum degree of sustainable well-being in a society.

The peace formula as presented is comprised of: 1) necessary ingredients 2) supporting conditions, and 3) the right process of putting them together

The **necessary ingredients** for peace are presented as:


| Ingredient                                                                                                                   | Examples                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Voice** Democratic participation and inclusive political representation                                                    | Free and fair elections, power-sharing, proportional representation, protection of civil liberties and minority rights        |
| **Work** Economic opportunities                                                                                              | Education, job creation programs, active labor market policies, social safety net?                 |
| **Warranties** Security guarantees and state monopoly on what is viewed as legitimate violence  | Professional military and police forces, peacekeeping operations, justice system enforcement, international security guarantees (e.g. NATO) |

**Supporting conditions**: Robust and responsive **state capacity** is emphasized as a critical supporting condition. Many other important things, like education, public health, healthcare, employment programs, etc. are downstream of that.

**Process**: Alluding to a hierarchy of needs, the book emphasizes safety and security, state capacity, and infrastructure (water, electricity) as foundations.
If these needs are not met, other ingredients of the peace formula, such as voice/political participation, cannot flourish. 

Case studies illustrating successes of the peace formula include economic opportunities, counseling, and training for men returning from combat in Liberia, 
economic opportunities for asylum seekers in Switzerland, 
and public health interventions to address the HIV epidemic in many countries in Africa and subsequent effects on building state capacity, increasing trust in government, and reducing conflict. 

# Impressions

### How well does the peace formula address *causes of war*?

Voice addresses asymmetrical information, but only about what people domestically think. This can diminish the likelihood of internal conflict.
It can also serve as a check on political bias and diminish commitment problems to some degree. 
But it does not address information problems relating to the strength or resolve of an unfriendly country. 
It also does not counter dis/misinformation. Overall, voice seems like a moderate-strong antidote to some causes of war.

Work diminishes the desire of people to directly join armed conflict, but it does not explicitly address any causes of war presented in the book. 

Warranties is a big one and tries to address commitment problems. 
The books talks about a lot of examples of effectiveness of security guarantees, at least in the immediate post-conflict stages. 

Indivisibilities are are not satisfyingly addressed, though voice (through power sharing) and warranties may alleviate it to some degree.

### How the peace formula contributes to *sustainable peace*

Safety and security, economic opportunities, and inclusive and representative government, supported by factors like robust state capacity - 
all designed to address people's basic needs and chance at opportunities and to build a decent life - seems like a strong foundation for domestic peace.

# Limitations and gaps

1. The peace formula does a strong, if incomplete, job of diminishing one-sided and two-sided civil conflict. That goes a long way.
There's less attention devoted to addressing causes of international conflicts. May be that's OK and outside the scope of the book? 

2. What causes of war are included (or not), and lack of clarity about where in the causal chain they belong: 
    - Intangible or non-material factors like grievances and negative sentiment developed toward another group, are discussed but don't seem to be viewed as causes of war.
    - Some causes, like political bias/private intentives are more of a direct cause. On the other hand, asymmetrical information belongs somewhere else. Yes, it's a "cause" in a causal inference/counterfactual framework, but may be it's more precise to classify it as an effect modifier (moderator?) [^2]

3. There's no distinction between defensive wars and wars of aggression. But the causes are different. The decisions to continue them might be distinct. 
   I wonder if this is related to lack of clear articulation of short- and long-term intangible incentives and their measurement in the discipline. 

4. I don't know to what extent dis/misinformation is a unique thing historically.
   I also wonder how the modern information environment affects perception of economic conditions, threats, and opportunity costs.
   In the US, [consumer sentiment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-21/consumer-views-of-the-economy-depend-on-who-s-president) has become partially a partisan issue, flipping by party affiliation after the 2024 presidential election.
   Moreover, some people express a nihilistic attitude and feel that they have nothing to lose. This perception has an impact on opportunity costs on participating in conflict.
   There was an article in *Political Behavior* by Michael Shepherd about how [people in rural areas blamed Democrats for hospital closures](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-024-10000-8), even though it's actually due to Republican policies that reduce funding for Medicaid and support for safety net hospitals.
   There's nothing in the peace formula that is an explicit antidote against this.

6. The final gaps might be in the IR/conflict literature and applications of rational choice theory - the foundations that the book rests on.
    - The rationalist view - that actors seek to maximize benefits (utility) for themselves - is a useful analytical framework. But the utility function that defines an actor's benefit of a particular action, like going to war or not, still does a poor job of integrating intangible motivations like grievances and negative sentiment toward another group. Factors like misperceptions, emotions, and cognitive biases that affect how potential benefits and risks are assessed - are still routinely overlooked. The few exceptions are prospect theory/loss aversion, but otherwise insights from psychology are largely not integrated unless recognized through a [Nobel Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2002/kahneman/facts/).
    - Unit of analysis: the actors are usually groups, states, elites. All important, but incomplete the more [personalist](https://academic.oup.com/book/57361/chapter-abstract/464652991) a regime is, i.e. the more power is concentrated in one individual leader with unchecked power (political bias described earlier, but the private incentives are of a single individual). In the case of a personalist regime, a utility function should include material and intangible motivations for war, yet the same limitation applies here. We now have so much data in the form of text, speeches, public statements and tools from computational social science to assess thigs like grievances, sentiment toward other groups, may be even pathological narcissism. The value of that information remains to be seen and tested. Yet once methods are established and validated, the cost of such assessment would be minimal. 
  
Overall, the book is excellent and I would recommend to everyone, despite the limitations above.
The material would also be valuable addition to civic education. 
Many people in democratic systems don't appreciate what makes those systems successful - including voice/representation as a growth and mistake correction mechanism.
