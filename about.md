The expression "positive peace" was popularized by sociologist and peace theorist Johan Galtung, but others including Martin Luther King Jr and late 19th/early 20th century pacifists like Jane Addams and Alfred Fried used it in their writings prior to him.

First, a broad taxonomy of stages of peace studies. These stages may overlap and are not necessarily  linear in their progression:
1. During violence
2. After violence
    - Stabilization
    - Transition
    - Relapse prevention
3. Maintenance & prevention of new conflict (e.g. security guarantees, institutional checks and balances)
4. Sustaining peace & positive peace cultivation

Most modern peace research is heavily concentrated on #1 and #2, and to a lesser extent #3. The more upstream you go, the less attention is generally devoted to it. 

The aims of this little blog are to:

- Explore causes of conflict and to devote attention to the upstream contributors
- Articulate conditions for sustainable peace and well-being that include, but are not limited to, traditional definitions of peace as the absence of prolonged violent conflict among groups
- Translate valuable insights from social sciences, often hidden behind layers of paywalls and jargon
- Present multidisciplinary perspectives on conflict and peace
