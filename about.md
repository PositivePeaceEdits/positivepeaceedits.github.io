# About Positive Peace

The expression "positive peace" was popularized by sociologist and peace theorist Johan Galtung, but others including Martin Luther King Jr and late 19th/early 20th century pacifists like Jane Addams and Alfred Fried used it in their writings before him.

First, a broad taxonomy of stages of peace studies. These stages may overlap and are not necessarily  linear in their progression:
1. During violence
2. After violence
    - Stabilization
    - Transition
    - Relapse prevention
3. Maintenance & prevention of new conflict (e.g. institutional checks and balances)
4. Sustaining peace and positive peace cultivation

Most modern peace research is heavily concentrated on #1 and #2, and to a lesser extent #3. The more upstream you go, the less attention is devoted to it. 

The purpose of this little blog is to spend more time exploring the upstream factors and to articulate conditions for peace and well-being that extend beyond traditional definitions of peace as the absence of conflict.

Thanks for dropping by!
